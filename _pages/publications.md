======
* **Beyond tie strength: The effect of tie variability on project development in the OSS community**, with Youngjin Yoo and Aaron Schecter, Revise and Resubmit at *Information System Research*

  This study introduces a new construct called tie variability, which complements the static effects of tie strength by analyzing their dynamic impact on project development within open-source communities.
  
* **From Code to Road: Examining the Role of AI Keywords' Network Embeddedness in Shaping Patent Innovations in the Autonomous Vehicle Industry**, with Dongyeob Kim, Youngjin Yoo, and Yoon Son, manuscript in preparation for *Strategic Management Journal* (submission expected in Sep 2024)

  This study employs staggered difference-in-differences and network analysis to identify the impact of cross-boundary AI knowledge on firm performance and innovation in patent generation.
  
* **Unraveling the Impact of Model Dependency Networks on the Propagation of Artificial Intelligence Innovation**, with Youngjin Yoo and Aaron Schecter, conditional accepted by *International Conferences on Information Systems (ICIS)*, 2024

This study integrates graph neural networks (GNN) and network analytics to examine how innovation in open-source communities and academia influence each other, much like the ripples in water. Additionally, it explores how the relationships between influence models affect the diffusion of AI innovations within the academic field.
