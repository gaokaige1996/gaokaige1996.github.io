I am Kaige Gao, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Design and Innovation at the Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, advised by Professor [Youngjin Yoo](https://case.edu/weatherhead/about/faculty-and-staff-directory/youngjin-yoo). I am currently on the job market for the 2024-2025 academic year.

I believe innovation results from interactions between diverse actors and artifacts. My research mainly focuses on leveraging large-scale trace data and computational tools to measure and understand these interactions. By utilizing dynamic network analysis in combination with machine learning, deep learning, and econometric models, I aim to uncover the mechanisms driving innovation. My work provides insights into the complex dynamics of innovation, helping to illuminate how various factors contribute to the development and diffusion of new ideas and technologies.
